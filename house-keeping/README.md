# TS-NP House Keeping

Tested only with node 13. But expected to run good on node >= 10.

## Usage

The target is to run the `src/gulpfile.ts`.

```sh
npm start
```

It renders the files in `/base-structure` to ejs supported files and copies them to `/generator/template` along with some meta files and processing.
